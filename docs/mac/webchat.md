# Web Chat (macOS app)

The macOS menu bar app shows the WebChat UI as a native SwiftUI view and reuses the **primary Clawd session** (`main` by default, configurable via `session.mainKey`).

- **Local mode**: connects directly to the local Gateway WebSocket.
- **Remote mode**: forwards the Gateway WebSocket control port over SSH and uses that as the data plane.

## Launch & debugging
- Manual: Lobster menu → “Open Chat”.
- Auto-open for testing: run `dist/Clawdis.app/Contents/MacOS/Clawdis --webchat` (or pass `--webchat` to the binary launched by launchd). The window opens on startup.
- Logs: see `./scripts/clawlog.sh` (subsystem `com.clawdis`, category `WebChatSwiftUI`).

## How it’s wired
- Implementation: `apps/macos/Sources/Clawdis/WebChatSwiftUI.swift` hosts `ClawdisChatUI` and speaks to the Gateway over `GatewayConnection`.
- Data plane: Gateway WebSocket methods `chat.history`, `chat.send`, `chat.abort`; events `chat`, `agent`, `presence`, `tick`, `health`.
- Session: usually primary (`main`); multiple transports (WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Desktop) share the same key. The onboarding flow uses a dedicated `onboarding` session to keep first-run setup separate.

## Security / surface area
- Remote mode forwards only the Gateway WebSocket control port over SSH.

## Known limitations
- The UI is optimized for the primary session and typical “chat” usage (not a full browser-based sandbox surface).
